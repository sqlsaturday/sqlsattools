      "description": "The goal of database performance tuning is to minimize the response time of your queries by making the best use of your system resources. The best use of these resources involves minimizing network traffic, disk I/O, and CPU time. This goal can only be achieved by understanding the logical and physical structure of your data, the applications used on your system, and how the conflicting uses of your database might affect performance.",

      "description": "The process of classifying a company into an industry segment has been around since the 1950’s.  Wikipedia has listed several popular taxonomies that are in current use.  Some industries are more regulated and have stricter compliance regulations than others.  The business requirement to provide an audit trail to a compliance officer when a security issue arises is “table stakes” in most organizations.\r\n\r\nSQL Server has had the ability to define an audit specification at the server or database level since 2008.  However, the actual changed data is not readily available for reversing the unwanted action.  In today’s complex team environments, certain key tables need to be protected against inserts, updates and deletes.  As a database administrator, how can we audit and prevent unwanted table changes? \r\n\r\nToday, we will go over a custom audit design pattern that uses database roles, table triggers and log tables.  This pattern will fulfill our business requirements.",
